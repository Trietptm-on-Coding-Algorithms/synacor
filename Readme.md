This is my solution to the Synacor programming challenge. The challenge can be 
found here: https://challenge.synacor.com/

I stumbled upon this challenge while participating in the Advent of Code, a set
of programming challenges for Christmas by the same author. 

The first part of the challenge is writing a virtual machine which supports 21
different operations. My implementation of the virtual machine can be found in
`src/cpu.rs`.
