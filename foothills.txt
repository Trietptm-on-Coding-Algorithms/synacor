Options: look, go, inv, take, drop, use

== Foothills ==
Don't go south from foothills, leads to a deadend
Pick up the tablet and use it for a key: SqFnvmsIDFdU

== Dark cave ==
Go straight until you fall down.

East:
Go east first, take the empty lantern

West:
Go west until you get to a ladder
The ladder is a maze

north -> north -> north is a cycle
south -> south -> south is a cycle
east probably has a grue
west -> north -> south -> north -> ... gives you a can

Use lantern in the darkness, keep going west

== Ruins ==

Keep going north, take the red coin
use the red coin to fill in the equation

_ + _ * _^2 + _^3 - _= 399

Go west and up, take blue and shiny coins
go east and down, take corroded and concave coins

red = 2
corroded = 3
shiny = 5
concave = 7
blue = 9

Answer is (9, 2, 5, 7, 3) (see coins.py)

Go north from here.

Use teleporter!

== Synacor headquarters ==
Take the strange book to see that the teleporter requires the eighth register to be set to a specific value...

Now you have to look at the assembly dump and figure out what the teleporter value is.

The cover of this book subtly swirls with colors.  It is titled "A Brief Introduction to Interdimensional Physics".  It reads:

Recent advances in interdimensional physics have produced fascinating predictions about the fundamentals of our universe!  For example, interdimensional physics seems to predict that the universe is, at its root, a purely mathematical construct, and that all events are caused by the interactions between eight pockets of energy called "registers". Furthermore, it seems that while the lower registers primarily control mundane things like sound and light, the highest register (the so-called "eighth register") is used to control interdimensional events such as teleportation.

A hypothetical such teleportation device would need to have have exactly two destinations.  One destination would be used when the eighth register is at its minimum energy level - this would be the default operation assuming the user has no way to control the eighth register.  In this situation, the teleporter should send the user to a preconfigured safe location as a default. 

The second destination, however, is predicted to require a very specific energy level in the eighth register.  The teleporter must take great care to confirm that this energy level is exactly correct before teleporting its user! If it is even slightly off, the user would (probably) arrive at the correct location, but would briefly experience anomalies in the fabric of reality itself - this is, of course, not recommended.  Any teleporter would need to test the energy level in the eighth register and abort teleportation if it is not exactly correct.

This required precision implies that the confirmation mechanism would be very computationally expensive.  While this would likely not be an issue for large- scale teleporters, a hypothetical hand-held teleporter would take billions of years to compute the result and confirm that the eighth register is correct. 

If you find yourself trapped in an alternate dimension with nothing but a hand-held teleporter, you will need to extract the confirmation algorithm, reimplement it on more powerful hardware, and optimize it.  This should, at the very least, allow you to determine the value of the eighth register which would have been accepted by the teleporter's confirmation mechanism.

Then, set the eighth register to this value, activate the teleporter, and bypass the confirmation mechanism.  If the eighth register is set correctly, no anomalies should be experienced, but beware - if it is set incorrectly, the now-bypassed confirmation mechanism will not protect you! 

Of course, since teleportation is impossible, this is all totally ridiculous.
